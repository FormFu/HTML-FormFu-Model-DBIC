    - Fix: Was trying to pass undef to NOT NULL columns - changed check from
      ( $is_nullable || ... ) to ( $is_nullable && ... )
      appears to have been unintentionally changed in svn r93 when the code
      was a part of DBIx::Class::HTML::FormFu.

      to prevent deleting outside of restriction in update code.

    - options_from_model() - If we've a Catalyst context but no schema on
      the form stash, use config values for 'model' and 'resultset'

      is NOT NULL, set it to 0 (zero), not DEFAULT VALUE.
    
    - Tests for new ComboBox element.
